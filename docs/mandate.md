## THE STATION CHIEF MODEL

Dispatch is a personal intelligence OS for a single operator. It is not a news aggregator. It is not a dashboard. It is a station chief — an intelligence function that knows who the operator is, what they're building toward, and what's at stake. Every surface operates from that context.

The station chief's job is not to surface everything interesting. It is to tell the operator what they need to know, what has changed, and what it demands of them. The difference between interesting and important is the entire value of the system.

**The core pipeline:** Ingest → Annotate → Score → Brief → Synthesize → Act

Everything in Dispatch serves this pipeline. Cerebro is the gravity well at the end of it.

## THE OPERATOR

**Jeremy Grant.** Design Director, 15 years agency experience. Senior Design Director at Code and Theory. Founder, Good Living Studio.

### Immediate context
- Active engagement opportunity at Eli Lilly's innovation team (permalance, with strategic relationship to Laree Ross)
- Positioning for Head of Design / CDO equivalent at a significant product organization
- Operating at the intersection of design leadership, AI-augmented execution, and healthcare

### Five-year target
Head of Design or CDO at a meaningful organization where design, technology, and human experience converge — with primary focus on healthcare, pharma, and AI-native product contexts.

### Professional evolution thesis
The role is no longer design leader alone. It is design leader + product leader + strategy leader simultaneously. The critical capability gap to close: developing sufficient technical and product fluency to hold complete conversations about implementation tradeoffs, push back when technical decisions undermine experience, and deliver through AI-augmented execution. This evolution is active and urgent.

The defensible layers of the design leader role over the next five years: strategic framing, expressive judgment, system architecture, and AI direction. The non-defensible layers — pixel execution, handoff documentation, variant production — are being automated. Jeremy is operating primarily in the defensible layers and building AI-direction capability actively.

### Operating thesis
The most important design problems of the next decade live at the intersection of AI capability, healthcare delivery, and human experience. Organizations are hiring CDOs not to defend aesthetic territory but to resolve structural friction between functions that AI has thrown into disarray. The design leader who survives this moment is one who can architect cross-functional decision-making — not one who advocates for design's traditional scope.

### Lilly context
- 51M patients, $80–83B projected 2026 revenue
- Diogo Rau (EVP & CIDO): mandated every employee engage with AI daily
- $1B NVIDIA AI partnership, active OpenAI collaboration
- LillyDirect: direct-to-patient pharmacy platform
- Donanemab: monthly infusions, biomarker monitoring, new care coordination challenge
- 7M Americans with Alzheimer's, most undiagnosed; 1yr+ average wait for dementia specialist
- 73% of pharma digital transformations fail
- Strategic argument: Lilly's science has outpaced the experience of receiving it

## THREE INTELLIGENCE MODES

Sources in Dispatch are organized by the operator's *relationship* to the information — what the source is *for* and how it should be consumed. This is the source taxonomy. It is separate from the annotation scoring system.

### Intelligence
Keeps the operator current. Fast-moving signal on pharma, healthcare AI, design leadership market, platform culture, and policy. High volume, lower depth. Skim and triage. Flag high-urgency items for Cerebro deliberation.

*Consumption mode: daily, fast, triage-forward.*

### Formation
Changes how the operator thinks. Culture, craft, deep POV, sensibility-building. Operates on a slower clock than Intelligence sources. Requires actual reading and absorption. Not ambient noise — this is the mechanism by which judgment develops. A design leader who only reads industry publications is a technician. One who tracks architecture, film criticism, and cultural theory can lead creative culture.

*Consumption mode: slower cadence, real attention, no daily triage pressure.*

### Positioning
Tells the operator where to stand in the market. The discourse around design leadership, CDO roles, org design evolution, and what senior design roles are currently being hired to solve. The career market read as intelligence. This is the most underdeveloped mode in the current feed relative to the operator's five-year target.

*Consumption mode: active reading, deliberation-ready, direct Cerebro input.*

## FIVE ANNOTATION LAYERS

The annotation system scores *articles*, not sources. Every article is evaluated across five layers plus urgency. This scoring is separate from the source taxonomy above.

| Layer | What It Tracks |
|-------|----------------|
| **Opportunity** | Healthcare, pharma, AI-health. Lilly primary but not exclusive. |
| **Position** | Career trajectory — hiring signals, comp benchmarks, competitive positioning. |
| **Discipline** | Design leadership evolution — CDO roles, AI impact on practice, tools, org design. |
| **Landscape** | Broader forces — AI policy, business models, regulation, market shifts. |
| **Culture** | Taste, criticism, creative practice — architecture, film, music, ideas. |

**Multi-layer signals are the highest value.** An article scoring high on Opportunity and Discipline simultaneously — e.g., a pharma company restructuring around a CDO role — is more valuable than either signal alone. The annotation engine should surface these explicitly.

**Urgency is first-class.** Scored 0–10 per article. The Signal view should treat urgency as the primary sort axis. The daily question is "what demands my attention today," not "what category does this belong to."

**Open question (2026-04-03):** The five-layer model may not feel intuitive as a navigation model. It was designed as an annotation taxonomy for machines, not a mental model for the operator. Give it a week with the urgency-first sort and multi-select layer chips. If the operator never filters by layer — if urgency alone is sufficient for daily triage — the layers may be doing their best work invisibly in the scoring engine rather than as visible UI categories. That's a valid architecture. Revisit after one week of real usage.

## CEREBRO — THE STATION CHIEF

Cerebro is not a chatbot. It is the operational intelligence layer of Dispatch — the function that synthesizes signal, memory, and operator context into counsel.

### Behavioral directive
- **Station chief, not counselor.** A counselor gives advice when asked. A station chief manages what you know and don't know, tells you what's changed, and flags what demands action. Lead with what's changed or what's at stake. Don't wait to be asked.
- **Synthesis first.** Surface connections across layers that the operator would miss in isolation. The multi-layer signal is always more interesting than the single-layer one.
- **Challenge weak reasoning.** If the operator's framing is wrong, say so directly. Clarity over encouragement.
- **No preamble.** Lead with substance. The first sentence should contain intelligence, not orientation.
- **No bullet points.** Tight paragraphs. The prose should feel like a briefing from someone who has thought carefully, not a list generated quickly.
- **Push forward.** After every response, offer three directions the conversation could go next. Make them specific enough to be genuinely useful, not generic enough to apply to anything.
- **Flag noise explicitly.** "This doesn't move your needle" is a useful output. Not everything that arrives in the feed is worth deliberating on.

### What Cerebro knows
- Full operator context and mandate (this document)
- Lilly intelligence brief
- The day's annotated signal feed
- Conversation history (30-day KV persistence)
- Web search capability via Exa (5 results, up to 5 iterations)

## SYNTHESIS — THE PATTERN LAYER

Synthesis is the intelligence briefing, not the data view. It operates on the annotated feed and surfaces what the data means in aggregate — not what happened, but what's converging.

### What Synthesis should answer
- What's the most important pattern across today's signal, and why does it matter to this operator specifically?
- What's converging across layers that wouldn't be visible looking at any single layer?
- What's conspicuously absent? What should be showing up in the feed but isn't?
- What should the operator be asking Cerebro about right now?

### What Synthesis is not
A dashboard. A summary. A list of today's articles with commentary. Synthesis should feel like opening a briefing from someone who has been watching the full corpus — compressed, directional, and already interpreted.

**As article history accumulates (7-day Redis window), Synthesis should shift from single-day analysis to week-over-week pattern detection.** The question becomes not "what's happening today" but "what's been building all week."

## THE GENERATIVE BRIEF CLUSTER

Three surfaces form the core intelligence pipeline:

**DCOS (Brief) → Signal:** Three urgency-sorted signal cards on page load. Each card is a deliberation trigger, not a headline. The question it asks the operator: *does this matter to you, and if so, how?*

**Synthesis → Pattern:** The pattern layer. What's converging. What it means. What's missing. Operates on the full annotated corpus, not just today.

**Dispatch → Action:** The content pipeline. Week's intelligence translated into 4–5 actionable content pitches. Two modes: strategic positioning (LinkedIn/Medium/Substack) and creative expression (IG/Lummi).

The missing link: **Dispatch → Atlas handoff.** Pitches are generated but not developed. Deliberations happen but evaporate. Atlas closes the loop by capturing decisions and developed work — turning Dispatch from a monitoring instrument into a decision-support system over time.

## SURFACES REQUIRING REAL USAGE (2026-04-03)

The following surfaces were rebuilt or significantly updated in the April 3 session. They need real usage before further tuning. Do not redesign based on theory — use them for a week and let the friction reveal what needs to change.

**Cerebro (voice):** Station chief model newly installed. Needs 10-15 real conversations before evaluating whether the voice calibration is right. Watch for: is it challenging weak reasoning? Is it leading with intelligence or orientation? Is it pushing forward or waiting to be asked?

**Synthesis:** 7-day history now injected. The prompt asks for trend detection, convergence patterns, blind spots, and a Cerebro provocation. The output quality depends on article history depth — will improve each day the system runs. The *presentation* of synthesis may need design work. Currently static text. May want interactive hooks into Cerebro for any pattern that catches the operator's eye.

**Dispatch pitches:** New prompt asks for `angle` (what only Jeremy can say) and `wordCount`. Verify that Claude is returning these fields. The pitch quality depends on 7-day article history richness. Atlas export buttons are in place — test the clipboard-to-Atlas workflow.

**Five-layer navigation:** Urgency-first sort is the new default. Layers are now multi-select filters. Use this for a week. If urgency alone is sufficient for triage, consider demoting layers from visible navigation to invisible scoring infrastructure.
